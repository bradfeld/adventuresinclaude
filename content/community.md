Adventures in Claude has an invite-only community for anyone playing with Claude Code and building things with AI.

## What We Do

- **Share projects** - Show what you're building with Claude Code, AI agents, and LLMs
- **Swap techniques** - Prompting strategies, MCP setups, Claude Code workflows, and tools that work
- **Discuss** - The future of AI-assisted development, what's working, what isn't, and where it's all going
- **Help each other** - Debug together, share solutions, and learn from each other's experiments

## How It Works

The community runs on [Discourse](https://community.adventuresinclaude.ai), which means you can participate via the web or entirely through email. Reply to notification emails to post, or use mailing list mode to get every message in your inbox.

### Categories

- **Introductions** - Who you are and what you're working on
- **Projects** - Show and tell for things you're building
- **Tips & Techniques** - What you've figured out that others should know
- **Discussion** - Everything else about AI, coding, and building
