I've been writing about Claude Code and AI development on [feld.com](https://feld.com) for the past few weeks. The Claude content kept growing - [CEOS](https://feld.com/archives/2026/02/streamline-workflow-with-ceos-claude-meets-eos/), [Freshell](https://feld.com/archives/2026/02/freshell-contributing-to-open-source/), [posting to WordPress with Claude](https://feld.com/archives/2026/02/claude-code-now-posts-to-this-blog/), [what I'm obsessed with](https://feld.com/archives/2026/02/tech-im-obsessed-with/). It needed its own place.

This is that place. Built with Hugo, deployed on Vercel, content pipeline powered entirely by Claude Code. You can read [how it all came together](/posts/2026-02-14-building-this-site/) if you're curious about the process.

The topics:

- Daily development with Claude Code - the workflows, the gotchas, the things that surprise me
- CompanyOS - building an AI-powered operations system for a two-person company
- Open source - contributing to projects like Freshell and releasing things like CEOS
- The craft of AI-assisted software development - what works, what doesn't, what I'm still figuring out

While I've played around with writing software for the past 45 years, I haven't written production code since 1992. That changed a little over a year ago when I wrote [Dinostroids](https://dinostroids.com/). 

While I still have plenty of investing responsibilities, my current obsession is understanding - by doing - the extremely rapid evolution of contemporary software development.
