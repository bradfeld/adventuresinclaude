A friend sent me a message today. He'd seen my post about using Claude to update WordPress and told me he'd just had Claude move his entire food blog off WordPress onto a Hugo static site hosted on GitHub Pages. "Literally just plan mode and say 'get me off WordPress and onto a Hugo static site,'" he said. "And the new site is insanely fast."

I've been writing about Claude Code and AI development on [feld.com](https://feld.com) for the past few weeks. Four of my last five posts were about this stuff. It deserved its own home.

So here we are. This site is built with Hugo and PaperMod, deployed on Vercel, and the entire content pipeline - from capturing notes during development to publishing posts - runs through Claude Code.

The topics:

- Daily development with Claude Code - the workflows, the gotchas, the things that surprise me
- CompanyOS - building an AI-powered operations system for a two-person company
- Open source - contributing to projects like Freshell and releasing things like CEOS
- The craft of AI-assisted software development - what works, what doesn't, what I'm still figuring out

While I've played around with writing software for the past 45 years, I haven't written production code since 1992. That changed a little over a year ago when I wrote [Dinostroids](https://dinostroids.com/). 

While I still have plenty of investing responsibilities, my current obsession is understanding - by doing - the extremely rapid evolution of contemporary software development.
