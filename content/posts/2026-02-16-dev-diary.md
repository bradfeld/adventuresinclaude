A friend called last week with a cancer diagnosis. The kind of call where the words register but your body goes numb first. By the time we hung up I was already thinking about the coordination problem - emails from five different people, appointments scattered across calendars, insurance calls nobody wrote down, and a patient too exhausted to organize any of it.

I purchased `curecancermagic.com` that night.

---

Today I built the app. All of it - from empty directory to six working features.

CureCancerMagic is a care coordination command center. The idea is simple: when someone gets a serious diagnosis, the 2-5 people helping them need a shared workspace. Contacts, communications, tasks, a timeline of appointments and test results. One place instead of a dozen scattered threads.

Phase 0 was a Google Workspace setup - shared Drive folders for medical records and treatment plans, a Google Sheet for contact tracking, Gmail labels for routing care emails. This gives the care team something usable *today* while the real app gets built.

Phase 1 registered the app in the Magic Platform monorepo. Slot 6, port offset 6. Package config, Vercel project, environment variables, Linear team with the CURE prefix. Fifteen tickets handled the infrastructure.

Phase 2 was the database schema. Six tables in a `curecancermagic` schema - cases, care team members, contacts, communications, tasks, and timeline events. Every table scoped through care team membership via RLS. The pattern: `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM care_team_members WHERE case_id = table.case_id AND user_id = (select auth.uid()))`. One RLS check gates everything.

Phase 3 was the part I cared about - the UI. Six features: auth and onboarding, a dashboard overview, contact management, communication logging, task tracking, and a visual timeline.

---

I used chain mode to build the Phase 3 features. `/start chain CURE-16 CURE-17 CURE-18 CURE-19 CURE-20 CURE-21` - six tickets, processed sequentially, plans auto-approved, commits between each one.

Each ticket got its own feature branch off `preview`. This means each branch starts clean - no accumulated state from previous tickets. The components I needed across all six features (the shared `database.ts` types file, the dashboard layout with navigation links) got recreated on each branch. Sounds wasteful. It's actually the right call - each branch is self-contained and mergeable independently.

The chain churned through them while I worked on other things. Contact management with search and role tracking. A communication log with manual entry for phone calls and notes. Task management with priority levels and assignee tracking. A visual timeline with upcoming/past sections, type-specific icons (calendar for appointments, flask for test results, heart pulse for treatments, trophy for milestones), and a left-border visual treatment.

Six branches. Six commits. Six Linear updates. The chain orchestrator tracked it all in `chain-state.json` and cleaned up after itself.

---

While the chain ran, I set up a [Discourse community](https://community.adventuresinclaude.com) for Adventures in Claude.

This was its own marathon - eighteen AIC tickets. A DigitalOcean droplet running Discourse's Docker-based install. DNS records for the subdomain. Resend for transactional email (Discourse needs outbound SMTP for account confirmations and notifications). Hugo site integration with a community link in the navigation. Backup scripts with automated scheduling. Health monitoring.

The email configuration was the fiddly part. Discourse expects SMTP credentials but Resend's SMTP relay uses API keys as passwords. The DNS records need both SPF and DKIM alignment for deliverability. Getting it all working required a few rounds of testing - send a test email, check spam folder, tweak DNS, try again.

The CEOS repo kept growing too. Four new skills landed today on top of yesterday's v1.0.0 launch - taking the total past twenty. CEO-28 through CEO-40 covered everything from new skill additions to documentation cleanup.

Platform maintenance ran in the background. A `/sweep` pass. Weekly quality report updates. Health commands audit across the infrastructure. The kind of work that doesn't make for exciting reading but keeps things from slowly degrading.

IntensityMagic got launch management features - scheduled messages, a WYSIWYG editor for launch content, and waitlist entry tracking. CompanyOS got an auto-sync fix with `--autostash` to handle dirty worktrees during config propagation.

---

Eighty-plus commits across five repositories. Forty-five tickets marked Done. One new app from zero to six features. One community forum from bare metal to running.

The thing that sticks with me from today isn't the code. It's the speed at which "I want to help my friend" turned into a working application. The monorepo infrastructure, the chain mode automation, the patterns I've built over the past month - they compressed what would have been weeks of work into hours.

Tomorrow I'll stage the CureCancerMagic branches and get them deployed to preview. The friend who needs this doesn't care about my architecture decisions. He needs a place to track his next appointment.
