I'm Brad Feld. I've been playing with technology since I got an Apple ][ for my bar mitzvah. I've co-founded a handful of companies including [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/), been a VC investor for 30 years, and have been blogging at [feld.com](https://feld.com) for over 20 years. I've also written a bunch [books about entrepreneurship](https://feld.com/books).

This site is where I write about building with AI - specifically Claude Code, the tool I use every day to build software. I'm the co-founder and very part-time CTO of [IntensityMagic](https://intensitymagic.com), where we're building a multi-product SaaS platform with a two-person team and a lot of AI.

Topics you'll find here:

- **Claude Code** - workflows, skills, commands, and daily development
- **CompanyOS** - running a company with AI agents
- **Open Source** - contributions and projects
- **AI Coding** - what works, what doesn't, and what I'm learning

The source for this site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/bradfeld/adventuresinclaude). It's built with Hugo and PaperMod, deployed on Vercel, and the entire content pipeline - from note capture to publishing - runs through Claude Code.
